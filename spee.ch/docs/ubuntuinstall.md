# Create Your Own Spee.ch on Ubuntu 16.x 18.x VPS

# Overview

## Prerequisites
  * Ability to use SSH (putty + public key for windows users)
  * Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 VPS with root access
    * Your login info ready
    * Exposed ports: 22, 80, 443, 3333, 4444
  * Domain name with @ and www pointed at your VPS IP
    * _alternatively, specify http://localhost:3000 as domain during speech configuration_
  * Ability to send 5+ LBRY credits to an address
  * Noncommercial use
    * _alternative configuration examples for nginx and certbot are [here](https://github.com/lbryio/spee.ch/tree/master/docs/setup/conf/nginx)_

## You'll be installing:
  * MySQL DB version 5.7 or higher
    * Default Port 3306
    * mysql_native_password plugin
  * NodeJS v8+
  * Caddy - https reverse proxy server
    * automatically obtains tls certificate
    * Redirects 80 (http) to 443 (https) to Speech on 3000 
  * Lbrynet DAEMON started on ports 3333 and 4444
  * Spee.ch started on port 3000

_note: throughout this guide you'll be replacing `{{xyz}}` with `yourvalue` omitting the brackets_

# 1. Setup OS and install dependencies
## OS

### Secure your server by creating a non-root sudoer.

As root# _create user and add to sudo group_
```
  adduser username
  usermod -aG sudo username
  su - username
```
As username: *paste public key in authorized\_keys*

  `cd`
  
  `mkdir .ssh`
  
  `nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

### Prep

ssh to username@domainname or username@ip_address

  ```
  sudo apt-get update -y
  ulimit -n 8192
  wget -qO- https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
  ```


## Git, Curl, Unzip, ffmpeg, imagemagick, Node

  `sudo apt-get install git curl unzip ffmpeg nodejs imagemagick -y`

## Clone speech either from your own fork, or from the lbryio/spee.ch repo.

  * For Developers - our master branch

  `git clone https://github.com/lbryio/spee.ch`

  * For Developers - your fork

  `git clone https://github.com/{{youraccount}}/spee.ch.git`

  `git clone git@github.com:{{youraccount}}/spee.ch` 

  * For Publishers and Content creators - stable release

  `git clone -b release https://github.com/lbryio/spee.ch`

## Prepare the scripts

  `chmod 750 -R ~/spee.ch/docs/setup`

# 2 Secure the UFW firewall

## UFW

  `sudo ~/spee.ch/docs/setup/scripts/firewall.sh`

  _if your distro isn't vanilla ubuntu 16 or 18, you may have to install it_

# 3 Install Caddy to handle https and reverse proxy

##  Get Caddy

  `curl https://getcaddy.com | sudo bash -s personal`

## Set up Caddy reverse proxy and ssl

  _Make Caddy's folders, copy the template, edit the Caddyfile, copy the caddyfile to its folder._

  ```
  sudo mkdir -p /opt/caddy/logs/
  sudo mkdir -p /opt/caddy/store/
  cp ~/spee.ch/docs/setup/conf/caddy/Caddyfile.template ~/spee.ch/docs/setup/conf/caddy/Caddyfile
  nano ~/spee.ch/docs/setup/conf/caddy/Caddyfile
   ```

   ( Change {{EXAMPLE.COM}} to YOURDOMAIN.COM )

  `sudo cp ~/spee.ch/docs/setup/conf/caddy/Caddyfile /opt/caddy/`

## Set up Caddy to run as systemd service

  ```
  sudo cp ~/spee.ch/docs/setup/conf/caddy/caddy.service /etc/systemd/system/caddy.service
  sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/caddy.service
  sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /opt/caddy/
  sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/local/bin/caddy
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl start caddy
  sudo systemctl status caddy
  ```

  `q` exits

  At this point, navigating to yourdomain.com should give you a 502 bad gateway error. That's good!

  Now you can make sure caddy starts when the machine starts:

  `sudo systemctl enable caddy`


# 4 Set up MySQL

## Install MySQL

  `sudo apt-get install mysql-server -y`

  ( During install, enter blank password each time if prompted. We'll set one during secure setup.)

  `sudo systemctl status mysql` (q to exit)

## Secure Setup

  `sudo mysql_secure_installation`
  
  * Password your_mysql_password
  * No to password validation
  * Y to all other options


## Login to mysql from root to complete setup:

  `sudo mysql` to enter mysql> console

  mysql>

  `ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'yourpassword123';`

  mysql>

  `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`

  `Control+D` to exit

  Verify:

  `mysql -u root -p` and then entering your_mysql_password should give you the mysql> shell

# 5 Get Lbrynet SDK Daemon

## Get the SDK

  We'll be putting it in /opt/lbry.
  
  `sudo mkdir /opt/lbry`
  
  `sudo wget -O /opt/lbry/latest_daemon.zip https://lbry.io/get/lbrynet.linux.zip`
  
  `sudo unzip -o -u /opt/lbry/latest_daemon.zip -d /opt/lbry`

## Set up lbrynet to run as systemd service

  We'll soon update the setup scripts. Meanwhile, here's an example lbrynet.service file. Again, fully replace {{USERNAME}}
  
  ```
  [Unit]
Description="LBRYnet daemon"
After=network.target

# Replace {{USERNAME}} with your username, e.g. `bob` or `speechuser`
[Service]
Environment="HOME=/home/{{USERNAME}}"
ExecStart=/opt/lbry/lbrynet start
User={{USERNAME}}
Group={{USERNAME}}
Restart=on-failure
KillMode=process

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```
`sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/lbrynet.service`


Then paste the above into the file and edit replacing {{USERNAME}} with yours.

Finally do the following.

```
 sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/lbrynet.service
 sudo systemctl daemon-reload
 sudo systemctl start lbrynet
 sudo systemctl status lbrynet
```

You'll find your lbrynet logs in ~/.local/share/lbry/lbrynet/lbrynet.log

Let's make our lives easier and link /opt/lbry/lbrynet in /usr/local/bin

  `sudo ln -s /opt/lbry/lbrynet /usr/local/bin/lbrynet`

Now we can `lbrynet` without `/opt/lbry`. Let's make sure we're back in our home directory.  `cd`

## Customize SDK settings

  These settings will prevent you and your users from spending your server's LBC on paid content. Full documentation is [here](https://lbry.tech/resources/daemon-settings).
  
  ~$
  
  `cd ~/.local/share/lbry/lbrynet`
  
  `nano daemon_settings.yml`
  
   copy and paste in the following code (Ctrl+Shift V)

  _upnp is unnecessary for a vps but may be useful behind a properly configured NAT_

  ```
  run_reflector_server: false
  max_key_fee: {amount: 0, currency: LBC}
  use_upnp: false
  auto_re_reflect_interval: 0
 ```
 
 `CONTROL+O` then `CONTROL+X` to save and exit
  
  Restart lbrynet sdk:
  
  `sudo systemctl restart lbrynet`
  
  `sudo systemctl status lbrynet`
  

## Display wallet address to which to send 5+ LBC.

  _note: These commands work when `lbrynet` is already running_

  `lbrynet commands` to check out the current commands

  `lbrynet address list` to get your wallet address

  `Ctrl + Shift + C` after highlighting an address to copy.

  Use a LBRY app or daemon to send LBC to the address. Sending LBC may take a few seconds or longer.

  `lbrynet account balance` to check your balance after you've sent LBC.

# 6 Set up spee.ch

## Build it

  `cd spee.ch`

  ~/spee.ch:

  `npm install`

  _note: if you have installed your own local chainquery instance, you will need to specify it in your own /site/config/chainqueryConfig.json_

  Once your wallet has a balance, run this:

  `npm run configure`    

  The script will ask for the following values:
   
    * Database: lbry
    * Username: root
    * Password: your_mysql_password
    * Port: 3000
    * Site Title: Your Site Name
    * Enter your site's domain name: https://example.com or http://localhost:3000
    * Enter a directory where uploads should be stored: (/home/{{username}}/Uploads) *
    _* if you're not sure, `pwd`_
     
  `npm run build`  (or `npm run dev` to build for developing)

  `npm run start`

## Try it

  Navigate to example.com!

# 7 Production

## pm2 to keep your speech app running

If your server is running in the terminal from the last section, `Control+C` it.

 `sudo npm install -g pm2` _There are tutorials online for avoiding sudo for npm i -g_

 `cd spee.ch`

 `pm2 start npm --name speech -- run start`

 While pm2 installed this way will restart the server, it will not rebuild it on changes. You'll do that manually as discussed before.

### 7 Maintenance Procedures

#### Update sdk daemon

  * Backup wallet (private keys!) to a safe place. It should be in ~/.local/share/lbry/lbryum/wallets.
  * `lbrynet stop`
  * Following the instructions in 5: Get the SDK will rename the old daemon and give you the new one.
  * `lbrynet start`
  * `lbrynet version`
  * `lbrynet account balance`

#### Update speech

 * Read the release notes to see if there are any breaking changes, address them
 * `pm2 stop speech`
 * `git pull origin release` (assuming you cloned release)
 * `npm i` if necessary
 * `npm run build`
 * `pm2 start speech`
 * Have an exotic energy drink
